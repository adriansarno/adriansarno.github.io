# Project
This plan is the online learning resource that I am publishing on the subject of Data Science.
I have taken the approach of covering the field from different perspectives,
including the Application Domain (for professional reference),
the Specialization Area (a breakdown commonly followed in academic circles) and
a Job Marked split (for matching the requirements of actual job opportunities)
For each topic, I write a brief summary of the mathematical model citing other sources (which can be books, papers or courses) and
I move on to present my own implementations of the algorithms in a variety of languages. Then I extend the implementation to a full stack demo,
which demonstrate the architectural design topics relevant to the developer of cloud-based applications.

The content is written on a minimalist blog publishing platform, to ensure that it does not consume more time than necessary,
but nevertheless it insumes considerable amount of publishing effort because it entails a variety of formats, including blog posts that reference regular
web pages, ipython notebooks and regular source code files published on github, demo apps deployed on heroku, videos on youtube, and
papers submitted to arxiv.

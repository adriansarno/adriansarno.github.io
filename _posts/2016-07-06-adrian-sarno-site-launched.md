I am experimenting with a simple platform to publish a blog, made of three basic components:

1. Site hosting, provided by Github.
2. A deployment service that automatically publishes the site every time you push to the master branch.
    * [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)
3. A text processor that reads markdown sources and builds a site of static html pages:
    * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure)
    * [Tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages)
